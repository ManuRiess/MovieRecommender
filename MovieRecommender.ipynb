    "\n",
    "To train a neural network, which should be able to recommend you good movies based on your rating-history, a large-scale dataset is needed. Therefore the [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) dataset is used. It contains:\n",
    "- 100.000 Ratings, each rating contains a one-to-five-star rating made by one user (with userID XY) on one movie (with userID YZ).\n",
    "- 943 Users, labeled with an userID, age, gender, occupation and zip-code\n",
    "- 1682 Movies, labeled with an movieID, title, release dates, IMDb URL and a list of genres\n",

    "You can find the full documentation of the dataset structure under ML_100_INFO.md\n",

    "First the data musst be imported in a usable dataformat to do some pre-processing. Also some analyzation can be done to get a feeling for the dataset, its content, diversity and limitations."
